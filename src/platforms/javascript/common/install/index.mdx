## When to use which Installation Method

Depending on the concrete needs of your application, you may wonder which installation method you should use.

### Why to use the Loader Script over NPM

Using the Loader Script is the easiest way to start using Sentry. You only need to add a script tag to your application, and we'll take care of setting everything up correctly for you.

- **Easy to set up**: You only need to add a script tag to your application.

- **Easy to upgrade**: We'll take care of always shipping the latest version of the SDK to you - no action needed on your side.

- **Easy to add additional configuration**: You can still configure Sentry to your liking via `Sentry.onLoad()`.

- **Lazy-loading for errors-only mode**: If you only want to use Sentry for errors, we'll only load the SDK when an error occurs. This means that we can reduce the amount of JavaScript loaded on your page until an error occurs.

  <Note>
    Note that when enabling Replay and/or Performance, the SDK will be loaded
    immediately because we need to capture what's happening on the page as early
    as possible.
  </Note>

### Why to use NPM over the Loader Script

While using the Loader Script has definite advantages, it also comes with some drawbacks:

- **No framework-specific initialization**: As of now, the Loader Script only serves the generic JavaScript Browser SDK. This means that you'll not get any React, Vue, or similar framework-specific initialization. If you need this, you'll need to install the framework SDK (e.g. `@sentry/react` or `@sentry/vue`) via npm.

- **Reduced public API**: The Loader Script only exposes a subset of public APIs (e.g. `Sentry.captureException()`, ...).

- **No control over the SDK version**: If you happen to need exact control over the SDK version, you'll need to install the SDK via npm.
